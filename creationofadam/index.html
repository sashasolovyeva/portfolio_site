          The most well-known fresco of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, The Creation of Adam is
          a fascinating example of mediation, mass reproduction and decontextualization of
          a ubiquitously famous artwork.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the Production mode, the user gets to see the artwork itself but is then invited to explore the space around them. To the left and right of the center of the AR Origin, there is text overlaid in the 3D-mode that tells the story of how the Creation of Adam (and the entire ceiling of the Sistine Chapel) ended up looking the way we know it today. If the user turns their device to space above them, they can see the entire ceiling of the Chapel. As an exciting addition, they can tap anywhere in the space which will animate the artwork and make it “snap” into its space in the ceiling, providing the user with the clue of where it is located in the space that is abundant with numerous rich visuals.
        </p>

        <p>
        The entire Mediation mode is overlaid with the ambient sound of a museum which provides a nice background to learn about how the Vatican directed and controlled mediation of the Creation of Adam. Other than the supporting text that is once again on the left and right, in the center of the view, there is a video that gives a glimpse of several pages on the museum’s website. Showcasing curatorial choices made during the production of the website, a 3D model of the entire Sistine chapel, visitor information, and social media contacts are shown.
        </p>

        <p>
        Finally, the Consumption mode is a dedication to the pop culture that the Creation of Adam bolstered over the years, which made it one of the most recognizable and reproduced artworks in the history of art. In this part, the user can look around to see a variety of re-imaginings of the original artwork, which include critical or aesthetic approaches. I tried to include a broad range of examples to get a point about different uses of theDer Spiegel / The Creation of Adam example artwork across. Side note and fun fact: even as I was finalizing the project and ran to a grocery store, this is what I saw in Edeka. Just goes to show both the ubiquitousness and decontextualization.
        </p>

        <p>
        Overall, this was a very fun project which allowed me to incorporate different types of multimedia in the exploration of a range of aspects and implications of a single element (the touching hands) from a famous artwork.
        </p>
