        <h4>Idea:</h4>
        <p>This experience allows the user to mash pieces of the 20th century's most famous
        artworks together and create collages that can be saved. The interface allows for two different kinds
        of approaches: educational and inspiration-searching.</p>
        <p>Educationally, the user is encouraged to critically
        think about the artwork they are modifying and infer the meaning artists put into creation of their art
        objects. There is also a "Learn and Get Inspired" tab that gives a context on the time the artists lived and their
        place of origin; each artist's profile is also linked to their corresponding page on the MoMA website to let
        the user see more of their art and biographies.</p>
        <p>For all those who are searching for inspiration, this is a perfect opportunity to experimentally mash different
        styles, colors and patterns for unexpected discoveries. Looking for the juxtapositions to form dynamically?
        Animate your canvas (and stop them at any point) for more unexpected contrasts and encounters. It also looks
        so fascinating!</p>

        <h4>Justification:</h4>
        <p>This project builds on an idea of natural learning happening through rapid juxtapositions
        of our old and new knowledge, as well as stark contrasts or notable similarities between seemingly
        unrelated pieces of art. The interface presents a unique opportunity for the user to interactively
        compare, contrast, juxtapose, and see how collisions of different styles and ideas give birth to new ways of seeing.
        </p>

        <h4>Technical documentation:</h4>
        <p>The most notable technical features of the project are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An off-screen buffer for the canvas (p5.js)</li>
          <li>Tabbing logic (js) to navigate between different panels</li>
          <li>A dropdown filter that controls which assets get generated for each artist (js)</li>
          <li>An onclick function allowing to choose an asset and make it appear on the canvas
          based on the mouse position (js + p5.js)</li>
          <li>HTML buttons with event handlers to let the user modify the objects or canvas in various ways
          </li>
          <li>A Backgrounds panel that sets a canvas background with a p5.js background() function</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Further development:</h4>
        <p>The possibilities of development of this interface are endless!
        Here is a number of ways the project can grow in the future:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Letting the user upload their own image to use as a collage background, as well
          as letting them choose a solid color.</li>
          <li>Letting the user rotate the objects after putting them on the canvas.</li>
          <li>Letting the user create custom animations / choose between different modes of animation (e.g. random movement,
          Perlin noise movement, rotation, collision detection, etc.)</li>
          <li>Creating a better user interface to easier move and edit objects, especially to resize them.</li>
          <li>Allowing the user to take notes on their findings during the creative process.</li>
          <li>Adding icons (instead of just a regular cursor) when the user goes into a Move, Edit or Remove modes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User manual:</h4>
        <p>Compare, contrast, juxtapose, and see how collisions of different styles and ideas give birth to
        new ways of seeing and approaches, to both a master's artwork and your own creative process.
        Choose an artist from a dropdown menu and click anywhere on the canvas to use pieces of their famous
        art for your collage! (do not drag and drop)</p>
        <p>Select Move to relocate any of the objects around the canvas.</p>
        <p>Select Edit to change width and height of any object.
        After pressing the Edit button, click on an object that you want to resize
        and use sliders to adjust width and height separately.</p>
        <p>Select Animate to make your sketch come to live! This exciting feature
        allows you to put all of your objects into motion. Be careful with this feature though:
        the original positions of your objects with not be stored.</p>
        <p>Select Remove and click on an object that you want to delete from your canvas.</p>
        <p>Select Clear to start from scratch.</p>
        <p>Finally, select Save to download your (static) collage as a .png file.</p>
