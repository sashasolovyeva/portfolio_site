<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">Postcards. Valentine cards. Envelopes to Russia, envelopes to Austria, envelopes to Cambodia. In short, another seventy dollars spent in Strand.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is something deeply wrong about discovering a mainstream bookstore everybody on campus brings up at least twice in a conversation by accidentally stumbling into it during one of your breakdowns three months into the semester. Apparently named after one of the most memorable streets in London, 18 miles of books, <em>Nevertheless, she persisted&nbsp;</em>written on the front wall? The only question is how you had managed to not notice this epitome of everything you love about humanity two blocks away from your dorm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strand is like a little journey in and of itself. You could see it as a metaphor of New York: extremely exhausting, full of things you do not need but buy anyway, ridiculously overpriced and yet you leave with the sole purpose of coming back the day after. Or you could be cheesy and claim that the shop is a semi-depressing metaphor of life itself: you start at the top next to jigsaw puzzles, glowing dinosaurs and teach-yourself art manuals, move to the main floor to find Big Gay ice cream cookbooks, <em>Make America Read Again&nbsp;</em>trendy teacups and popular fiction like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close<em>,&nbsp;</em>only to head to an underground level stocked with vinyl, weird 1960s second-hand posters and shabby motivational speaker-acclaimed copies of Seven Spiritual Laws to Success<em>.&nbsp;</em>Or, being honest with yourself, you can admit to perceiving Strand as your last overcrowded escape to get last-minute presents for Christmas or a treat-yo-self kind of product for finals. You do not have a good reason for standing in a tourist-stocked line with four <em>Strand est. 1927&nbsp;</em>purses eight hours before your plane to Moscow on 24<sup>th</sup> December and yet there you are, being greeted 40 minutes later by a Rudolf antlers-wearing employee to inform you of all the Christmas present deals you have missed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">Holiday season is a special theme for Strand when it starts actualizing its true purpose of existence even more than the shop&rsquo;s first director Benjamin Bass or a current owner Nancy Bass Wyden have ever dreamt it would. During this time of the year you leave Strand simply to walk into a Strand kiosk up the street in the Union Square Christmas market and then once again in Midtown. All the holidays you have rediscovered since moving to the US are entangled into one complicated knot of feelings you have experienced in the shop. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine&rsquo;s day &ndash; you do not go there just for presents, decorations or outfits; holiday atmosphere in a heated room full of shining, excited people is what attracts and enchants you. As you carry a heart on a sleeve to any person who is willing to talk to you for longer than fifteen minutes, your NYU friends know not only about your weird emotional investment into the store, but particular aisles you make circles around giving <em>subtle</em> hints as to what you might want for your birthday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&ldquo;Sasha, have you literally decided to have a birthday brunch a block away from Strand&hellip;? What an icon.&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&ldquo;What a coincidence, right?&rdquo; &ndash; you say in your usual sarcastically-sounding tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&ldquo;What a coincidence to see a present wrapped in a Strand giftwrap, how original of you,&rdquo; &ndash;<em>&nbsp;</em>you think to yourself and try to act surprised when you get a space-themed tea cup, a #<em>grlpwr&nbsp;</em>pin and two pairs of socks with kittens and sprinkled donuts.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your most recent visit fell into an I am-here-for-the-holiday-atmosphere-and-exhausting-choices pattern as well. A promise to start using snail mail for postcards just for the sake of being extra and an unwitting obligation to send a parcel for your traditional high school Secret Valentine are two bits of motivation to keep you inside until an employee kicks you out at 10:02 pm. There is no sign of disappointment on your face though as you are carrying eight Valentine cards, one postcard with a battered pigeon on top of the Empire State building (a perfect choice for a valuable souvenir from New York) and ten postage stamps in a shape of full moons saying <em>Global / USA / Forever / 2016&nbsp;</em>around the perimeter.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holiday season is not the only time when Strand draws you in like a magnet attracts swarf; 12<sup>th</sup> street and Broadway could not be a more perfect location for a shop to change your plans whenever you are going to Palladium hall<em>&nbsp;</em>for a<em>&nbsp;quick no-nonsense&nbsp;</em>brunch<em>.&nbsp;</em>And yet, despite frequenting the shop and being able to tell the employees apart by their outfits, you are never recognized by them like some other regulars are. For a while you think about it as a result of working in a highly popular store near Union. Then maybe they simply do not bother enough to acknowledge your presence. Then you even claim that you have made some reassuring eye contact. And then, for better or for worse, you get over your social awkwardness and approach one of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&ldquo;It must be so cool working in Strand. Would you mind helping me out with something?&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em>A smile, some interest, a nod. I was right. &ldquo;Could you tell me about the history of the place? Or any cool stories you have witnessed working here? Working on a writing project, you know.&rdquo; A confusion, an excuse, a disappearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&ldquo;You can make an official contact with the shop administration if you wish. Do you want me to put you in touch?&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em>Talk about social awkwardness.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you wanted to know dry facts you would just pull up a Wikipedia page, something you had already done right after you had unpacked four new books after the very first visit. A broken faith in your imaginary friendships with employees does not change much; maybe just your perception of New Yorkers and, quite slightly, a frequency of visits to the shop. After all, even if you are a type of a person who makes the best effort to never come back to a place where they had made even a slight fool of themselves, you are also a type of a person who never, ever forgets their moments of unconditional smiling. That smile occurring from ear to ear when you first discover the bookstore that plays Sinatra&rsquo;s Theme from New York, New York<em>&nbsp;</em>on repeat and prompts you to spend 80 out of a $100 you have on socks, books and <em>36 felt-tip pens ultimate pack.&nbsp;</em>And, when completely emotional, you go outside to witness the most beautiful sunset and run all the way to the Flatiron District chasing the sun. <em>That</em> unconditional smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be fair with your feats to empty your bank account, you have to acknowledge that everything about the store screams irrational money spending. It was started by a Lithuanian immigrant who had nothing but $300 in savings. Food? Shelter? Transportation? Who needs those as an immigrant in New York if you can borrow $300 more to try opening a bookstore after you had completely failed on the first try and had been left on the street?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">Benjamin Bass&rsquo;s nights on a cot would eventually transform into a huge flagship store and a legacy of one of the mainstream go-to places in Manhattan that according to the <em>National Post</em> &ldquo;have been helping make New Yorkers more literate.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> As a lonely kid with exactly 156,983 soul-searching thoughts who recently concluded that she got stuck somewhere between Moscow and New York and does not belong in either, you could not have found a more relatable and, weirdly enough, inspirational story. Your first text after coming back from Strand could not be more telling. &ldquo;hey Liza. found a perfect bookstore. totally stealing a couple of ideas for our own&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;yes, I am indeed talking about that one we&rsquo;re opening in iceland when we&rsquo;re rich&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with daydreaming about owning a scandinavian bookstore, shut up&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">At the same time, you hate the feeling of being confronted by the store&rsquo;s silent yet pressing question: &ldquo;Will you ever be brave enough to take a risk for something you want?&rdquo; Immediate Broadway surroundings of Strand do not provide any escape from the dilemma either, and nor does a connection the store apparently has with its fellow <em>true&nbsp;</em>New Yorkers. In what other city in the world would a bookstore sell book libraries for $75/foot (or $350/foot for antique exclusives in case you, a college student, were wondering)? Or go as far as renting them out for those who want to impress their dates by their &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; but cannot afford even half a foot of those bougie pre-made libraries?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You spend a great deal of time inside Strand trying to understand a type of visitors you can relate to. Squealing tourists anxiously trying to send too many postcards home through Strand&rsquo;s red mailbox; pretentiously aristocratic smart-asses standing between aisles and discussing that one book with <em>deep layers of metaphysical existentialism&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;an intricately-written metaphorical plot</em>; the New School artsy hipsters who came for a new vinyl despite not having a vinyl player, <em>true&nbsp;</em>New Yorkers who came in to see how <em>this dear place has changed since 1998</em>, random locals who have better things to do but they do not, book worms with an aura of disapproval who came to sell that one book they re-read thrice, university girls who forgot to buy a birthday present for their friend and jumped on the last train to do so. Being a spectator of this procession, you stand in a corner painstakingly choosing a Christy novel and realize that this it: a whole stream of creation huddled into a 5x5 space. Your emotional Strand-perception parabola has just reached its vertex.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As profound as it sounds, most of the times it is nothing like this philosophically &ldquo;exalted&rdquo; experience. Usually you stumble in last minute to buy a retro <em>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&nbsp;</em>t-shirt for a Spooky Astronomy Halloween party in the Hayden Planetarium. You stumble in and run into your crush, smile awkwardly and disappear between aisles mumbling &ldquo;well<em>&nbsp;</em>next time<em>&nbsp;</em>I am <em>totally</em> talking to her&rdquo;. You stumble in to take a picture of a rainbow pattern of books above the cashier. You stumble in to memorize a precise shape of a humpback whale they are using to symbolize the Fiction section to sketch it later. You stumble in to fulfil your Black Friday spending plans even though Strand does not have Black Friday deals. You stumble in after an exhausting class fed up with your inability to concentrate and you could not care less about the place&rsquo;s significance anymore. You stumble in to be aggressively reminded of the place&rsquo;s significance as well as the significance of the fact that you, as <em>Hamilton&nbsp;</em>puts it, happen to be &ldquo;in the greatest city in the world&rdquo;. You stumble in after an unproductive all-nighter and a million attempts of writing an essay to get some motivation from a smell of books. At these moments, you could not agree more with an author of Strand-dedicated <em>New Yorker&nbsp;</em>cover who said in her commentary: &ldquo;</span><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:Times;color:black;">Bookstores are really good places for inspiration &ndash; you see people interacting with the books they have an affinity for, you see how people consume the culture. Sometimes someone will be dressed in a similar way to things he or she is looking at.&rdquo;</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">Strand, in its turn, somehow <em>always&nbsp;</em>happens to be there for <em>you</em>, on your way from point A to point B, and you will never stop rambling about a phenomenon of not noticing a city spot for months and then losing an ability to overlook it whenever you are in a radius of a mile. You could make your visits way more special by finally signing up for an in-person book presentation or one of the bookworm events Strand hosts every other day such as a Galentine&rsquo;s day gathering on February 13<sup>th</sup> (could there be a more exciting holiday than the one originating from an episode of <em>Parks and Rec</em>?). You could watch <em>Remember Me&nbsp;</em>with Robert Pattison as an enamored Strand employee, you could even specifically find an episode of BBC TV series <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em>, a Christmas special <em>Gay&nbsp;</em>to see a different look of the place back in 2002, or that one from <em>Sex and the City</em>, but you do not. Your Strand is so different from anyone else&rsquo;s that you eventually become worried it could be spoiled by any of your impressions of the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world and never bring it up in conversations about favorite places in New York City.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:19px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:200%;">Postcards. Valentine cards. Envelopes to Russia, envelopes to Austria, envelopes to Cambodia. In short, another 70 dollars spent in Strand. After all, you have to go past your own obsession with symbolism and come to two simultaneous realizations &ndash; New York is too crazily hectic to fit a mold of even the most obscure metaphor, and it is a small Strand that entirely shaped your view of the large New York, and <em>never</em> the other way around.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: inherit;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
