					The main project of my internship at National Public Radio as a part of the design operations team was a research into the possibilities of design tokens
					to simplify the handover of SVG icons from designers to developers.
					Establishing a new wokflow meant working around a complex architecture of the NPR's web assets, re-organizing how SVG icons are stored on the server,
					and developing a new design system for web icons and their colors.
					<br>
					This project is currently in progress and documentation is being constantly updated!

					<h4>First things first: what are the design tokens?</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>A system to cascade styles defined in one document (i.e., a Figma doc) down to all platforms with one (or maybe, 2-3â€¦) clicks.</li>

						<li>Allows to organize a robust system in one place and integrate on different platforms using the same process and logic.</li>

						<li>Can help codify: colors, typography, grids, sizes, spacing, padding, media queries, radii, borders, and icons.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Philosophy behind the design tokens</h4>
					<p>
						An often-overlooked part of modern product design is the efficiency of designer-to-dev or design system-to-final product pipelines.
						With an increased attention towards user-facing design (which is undoubtedly super important!), many teams sacrifice designing a better
						process of the handover of design assets and interfaces. This is where design tokens can come into play, allowing a
						designer, upon completion of their edits, automatically send them into Git and cascade them all the way into a mobile or web app
						with a few automatization tools.
					</p>

					<h4>Why design tokens are super useful for a big org (like NPR)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>They bridge the gap between designers and developers, since the usage of the workflow doesn't require coding knowledge
							(accessibility of tech tools is important on all levels).
						</li>
						<li>They help to avoid any need for communicating with developers (unless you want to!)</li>
						<li>Since Style Dictionary can parse tokens for as many different platforms as needed,
							they open up potential for a single-source, easy-to-update design system
							(this part didn't at all make it into the MVP. One day!..)
						</li>
						<li>
							Many ways to organize styles and many use-cases (more on that below!)
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>SVG icons use-case</h4>

					<p>
						Originally, I was exploring design tokens for the mobile version NPR's listening service <a href="https://one.npr.org/" target="_blank">NPR One</a>.
						However, when the web team for <a href="https://www.npr.org/">npr.org</a> had run into an issue of a disorganized
						directory of SVG icons (many duplicates, inconsistent sizing and coloring, etc.), I realized that design tokens
						would be very well-fitted to solve it. <br>
						I figured out a system of storing SVG icons separately from their colors,
						and using a plugin <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1012112455906916204/DSync">DSync</a> (credit to Liza Svitanko),
						built a system of packaging the SVG code and color information together.
					</p>

					<h4>Auxiliary work</h4>

					<p>
						In order to figure out the most effieicent structure of structuing SVGs, I partnered up with developers on the web team
						to conduct a comprehensive audit of existing icons and track where they are stored, the logic behind
						color variations, and calls from externals servers.
