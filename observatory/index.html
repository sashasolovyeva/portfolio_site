				<h4>Idea:</h4>
      <p>Inspired by my visit to SAO RAN (Special Astrophysics Observatory of the Russian Academy of Science) this summer,
        and an opportunity to work on a material about the local scientists' lives and work, I wanted to create an experience
        that would let the user explore this unique place in an interactive, unconventional way, and learn more about
        what astrophysists do in their daily lives.</p><p>
        The user is able to navigate the experience by creating motion on either side of their camera.
        They can then teleport themselves to one of the three places in the observatory: the lab building, the telescope tower, or the Bukovo township.
        Each of the locations invites the user to read a piece of an essay I have written about it and, in an experimental fashion,
        to control scrolling the text with their motion.</p><p>
        Additionally, in the telescope tower part of the experience, the user is able to rotate the tower around and take a peek at
        what the telescope looks like when it starts its work at the beginning of every night.
      </p>

      <h4>Justification:</h4>
      <p>Why motion detection? I was really impressed by an old remote controller that had been used to control telescope in a pre-digital era;
      with its long, full of switches and triggers body, the controller required a lot of motion and attention to operate.
      Using an image of the controller in the experience, and making the user make precise movements to explore the space around them,
      seemed fitting to immerse them inside the life of the observatory.</p><p>
      I acknowledge that there might be better mediums out there for a more seamless UX, especially when it comes to reading long-form
      materials online, but I believe this is an interesting experiment in reimagining how we navigate the web, taking away regular scrolling
      (minimal amount of motion) and making the user physically and actively engage with the content.
      </p>

      <h4>Technical implementation:</h4>
      <p>Some of the techniques, frameworks and assets that are used in this project are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>p5.js, AR.js, A-Frame, and Professor Kapp's library that adapts A-Frame to easy usage with p5</li>
        <li>Motion detecton algorithm</li>
        <li>Telescope sound recorded at the James Gregory Telescope in St. Andrews, Scotland from freesound.org</li>
        <li>Mountain and tree assets from Google Poly (rip Google Poly :()</li>
        <li>The lab building texture (Adobe Photoshop) and the BTA tower (assembled by me out of 3D primitives)</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming to construct entry points, stars, and some of the buildings</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Project iterations:</h4>
      <p>This project was initiated as a <a href="https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~as11303/interactive/assignment06/">virtual reality experience</a>
        but eventually, the AR medium was chosen for the aforementioned reasons of experimentation and interactivity. However, I have
        interest in a continued engagement with the observatory content, and I am curious to further develop the VR version, for an alternative
        way of presenting my long-read essay in a user-friendly but exciting way.
      </p>

      <h4>Further development:</h4>
      <p>
        Other than the aforementioned curiosity in VR, I think there is quite a lot of opportunities with capitalizing on the possibilities of
        computer vision. For example, it would be great to use motion detection in 3D visualizations of actual space objects
        (another trajectory for future development) in order to let the user to immersively learn about astrophysists' methods and objects
        of research.</p> <p>Other than that, of course, motion detection in this project does not always work seamlessly, so integrating other computer
        vision techniques would be a great next step to make this virtual space even easier to navigate and decipher.
      </p>
